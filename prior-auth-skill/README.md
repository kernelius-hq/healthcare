# Prior Authorization Review Skill

Automate payer review of prior authorization requests using AI-powered clinical reasoning and coverage policy matching.

---

## Overview

This Claude Code skill automates the health insurance payer's prior authorization (PA) review process. It processes incoming PA requests from healthcare providers, validates medical necessity against coverage policies, and generates authorization decisions with complete documentation.

**Target Users:** Health insurance payer organizations (Medicare Advantage, Commercial, Medicaid MCOs)

**Value Proposition:**
- Reduce PA review time from 30-60 minutes to under 5 minutes
- Enable auto-approval for 40-60% of straightforward cases
- Consistent, auditable decision-making
- Regulatory-compliant documentation
- Free clinical reviewers to focus on complex cases

---

## Key Features

✅ **Automated Request Intake** - Validates member eligibility, provider credentials, and extracts clinical data
✅ **Coverage Policy Matching** - Identifies applicable LCDs/NCDs and medical policies
✅ **Medical Necessity Assessment** - Maps clinical evidence to policy criteria
✅ **Decision Generation** - Generates approvals, denials, or pends with complete rationale
✅ **Provider Notifications** - Creates regulatory-compliant approval/denial/pend letters (supports custom templates)
✅ **Audit Trail** - Complete documentation for compliance and appeals defense
✅ **Resume Capability** - Can pause and resume at any subskill

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Invoke the skill:**
   ```
   Use the prior-auth-review-skill
   ```

2. **The skill will check for existing requests:**
   - If incomplete request found, you'll be prompted to resume or start new
   - If no request exists, workflow begins at Subskill 1

3. **Provide PA request details:**
   - Member information (name, ID, DOB, state)
   - Requested service (type, description, CPT codes, ICD-10 codes)
   - Provider information (NPI, name, specialty)
   - Clinical documentation (paste notes, upload file, or summarize)

4. **Subskill 1 executes automatically:**
   - Validates credentials and codes (NPI, ICD-10, CPT/HCPCS)
   - Searches coverage policies
   - Extracts clinical data
   - Assesses medical necessity
   - Generates recommendation

5. **Review and proceed to Subskill 2:**
   - Review assessment summary
   - Confirm to proceed to decision subskill

6. **Receive final decision:**
   - APPROVED: Authorization number, validity dates, provider letter
   - DENIED: Specific denial reasons, appeal rights, provider letter
   - PENDING: Documentation requests, deadline, provider letter

---

## Configuration Options

### Auto-Approval Thresholds

Edit subskill files to adjust:
- Confidence threshold for auto-approval (default: 90%)
- Cost threshold for human review (default: varies by payer)
- Service types eligible for auto-approval

### Data Source Customization

Replace default healthcare data sources with your organization's systems:

**CPT/HCPCS Code Validation**
- **Default:** CMS Physician Fee Schedule (WebFetch to cms.gov)
- **Custom option:** AMA CPT API with your license key
- **Configure in:** `subskills/01-intake-assessment.md` Step 4

**Coverage Policy Database**
- **Default:** CMS Coverage MCP Connector (Medicare LCDs/NCDs)
- **Custom option:** Your organization's medical policy database (custom MCP server)
- **Configure in:** `subskills/01-intake-assessment.md` Step 3

**Provider Verification**
- **Default:** NPI MCP Connector (NPPES national registry)
- **Custom option:** Your provider network and credentialing database
- **Configure in:** `subskills/01-intake-assessment.md` Step 2

### Decision Logic Customization

Customize validation failure policies in `rubric.md`:
- **STRICT vs LENIENT enforcement** for each validation type (provider NPI, code validity, medical necessity)
- **Automatic DENY vs PEND outcomes** for validation failures
- **Override authority rules** for clinical reviewers
- **Pre-configured examples:** Lenient mode (default to PEND), strict compliance mode, auto-approval mode

Edit [rubric.md](rubric.md) to adjust decision logic without modifying skill implementation files.

### Coverage Policies

Configure policy data sources in Subskill 1:
- CMS LCD/NCD databases
- Payer-specific medical policies
- State Medicaid policies
- Clinical guidelines databases

### Notification Templates

Place custom letter templates in the `template/` folder. The skill automatically detects and uses templates for approval, denial, or pend letters.

See **`template/README.md`** for:
- Complete list of 20+ available placeholders
- File naming conventions
- Template creation examples
- Fallback behavior

If no custom template is found, the skill uses built-in default templates with standard letterhead and regulatory disclosures.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**MCP Connectors Not Available**
- Verify healthcare MCP connectors are configured (CMS Coverage, ICD-10, NPI)
- See SKILL.md Prerequisites section for MCP connector requirements

**Low Confidence Warnings**
- Indicates incomplete or vague clinical documentation
- Request additional documentation from provider or use PEND decision

**Policy Not Found**
- Service may not require PA or policy database may be incomplete
- Continue with general medical necessity review or request manual policy research

**File Write Errors**
- Check waypoints/ and outputs/ directories exist with proper write permissions
- Verify available disk space

For detailed error messages and troubleshooting steps, refer to SKILL.md error handling section.

## Limitations

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** This skill generates draft authorization decisions for payer clinical review processes.

**Not a substitute for:**
- Human clinical judgment in complex cases
- Payer medical director oversight
- Regulatory compliance review
- Legal review of denials

**Required before final authorization:**
- Clinical reviewer validation (for non-auto-approved cases)
- Medical director sign-off (per payer policy)
- Compliance review (for denials)
- Quality assurance sampling

**Known Limitations:**
- Simulated policy database (requires real payer data integration)
- Simulated eligibility verification (requires real eligibility system)
- Limited to English-language documentation
- Requires structured clinical notes (not handwritten)

---

## Compliance & Security
